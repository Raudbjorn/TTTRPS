To receive webhooks, you must configure a webhook endpoint URL in your Rapyd dashboard. When an event occurs, Rapyd sends a POST request to your endpoint with details about the event in the request body. You should respond with a 200 status code to acknowledge receipt."

The signature is created by concatenating the HTTP method, URL path, salt, timestamp, access key, secret key, and request body, then hashing with HMAC-SHA256. The salt should be a random string, and the timestamp should be the current Unix timestamp."

Test card numbers are available for different scenarios including successful payments, declined payments, and 3D Secure authentication. Webhook events can be triggered manually in the sandbox dashboard for testing webhook handling."
